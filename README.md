# End of Mending

This mod removes the mending enchantment from survival play, and reworks the anvil repair cost calculation to never make repair inaccessible.

Repair cost is calculated based on the number of enchants on an item, and does not increase with each repair. Materials required for a full repair are also reduced from 4 to 2.
